    "- Event Type Distribution: Substitutions are the most common event, followed by goals and cards.\n",
    "- Temporal Trends: The number of events varies across years, and most goals and cards occur in the latter half of matches.\n",

    "- Data Completeness: The dataset may not cover all relevant aspects of game events (e.g., detailed player actions, precise event timings).\n",

    "- Strategic Decisions: Clubs and coaches can use these insights for strategic planning and player management.\n",

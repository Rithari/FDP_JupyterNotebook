    "* How do market values vary across different player characteristics?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",

    "The initial view of the `players.csv` dataset reveals several key aspects and potential areas of interest:\n",

    "    * Columns like `player_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `name` provide basic identification details for each player. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * These columns can be used to uniquely identify players and understand the dataset's diversity in terms of player representation.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   * Columns like `height_in_cm` and foot (which has missing values in some cases) offer insights into the physical attributes of players.\n",

    "3. **Professional Details**:\n",
    "    * Information about players' professional career is captured in columns like `last_season`, `current_club_id`, `current_club_name`, and `position`. This allows for an analysis of players' career trajectories and current affiliations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `sub_position` provides a more detailed view of the player's role within the team.\n",

    "# Reasonable Assumptions\n",
    "Based on the plotted graphs, a few observations can be made:\n",
    "## Top Clubs with Missing Market Values\n",
    "- **Higher Missing Values in Lesser-Known Clubs**: The clubs at the top of the chart, with the highest percentage of missing data, seem to be lesser-known or potentially lower-division clubs. This could indicate that market values are less frequently assessed or reported for these clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Possible Data Collection Gaps**: The presence of clubs with parentheses and years (e.g., \"- 2016\") may suggest these are defunct clubs or have undergone significant changes, possibly affecting the availability of up-to-date market value data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Countries with Missing Market Values\n",
    "- **Smaller or Less Prominent Football Nations**: Many of the countries listed, such as North Korea, Tahiti, and Monaco, have less prominent football scenes. This most likely contributes to the lack of available market value data for players from these nations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Availability Correlation**: The chart may reflect a correlation between the prominence of the country in the international football landscape and the availability of market data. More established footballing countries likely have more comprehensive data collection practices in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations suggest a potential bias in data collection toward players from more prominent football clubs and countries. For a more accurate analysis, it might be necessary to consider these biases and potentially adjust for them or focus on subsets of data where information is more complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the presence of clubs that no longer exist or have undergone significant changes raises questions about the temporal relevance of the data. It would be important to consider the time frame of the data collection and how it relates to current football market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Countries and Clubs with Missing Height Information\n",
    "The first two charts focus on the missing `height_in_cm` data. We see a diverse range of countries, including Malawi and Kyrgyzstan, at the top. Similarly, clubs like Hvidovre IF and Orduspor are leading with missing height information. The presence of smaller or less internationally prominent countries and clubs could indicate that such data is less frequently recorded or reported for players from these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Countries and Clubs with Missing Contract Expiration Dates\n",
    "The next two charts illustrate the missing `contract_expiration_date` data. It’s noticeable that countries like Laos and Oman and clubs like GFC Ajaccio and Metalurg Donetsk feature prominently. This suggests potential challenges in obtaining contract details from certain regions or perhaps a lesser focus on maintaining up-to-date contractual information for players in less prominent footballing nations and clubs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Countries and Clubs with Missing Agent Information\n",
    "The final two charts depict missing `agent_name` data. Countries such as Pakistan and Sint Maarten, along with clubs like Kayseri Erciyesspor and Beerschot AC, are at the forefront. This missing data could be due to a variety of factors, including the possibility that players in these regions are less likely to have formal representation or that such information is not as readily available or deemed as important in certain footballing communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "The patterns suggest that missing data is not randomly distributed but is instead associated with certain countries and clubs, potentially reflecting the resources, data collection practices, and the overall prominence of football in these regions. Clubs that have years in parentheses may indicate that the data pertains to a period when these clubs were active, which could affect the availability and relevance of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, missing height data might not be as critical for certain analyses as missing contract or agent information, which could have more direct implications for understanding a player's market situation or professional relationships.\n",

    "# Insights and Conclusions\n",
    "## Key Findings:\n",
    " * The age distribution of players indicates a healthy representation across various career stages, with a peak in the mid-to-late 20s. This suggests a typical age profile for active professional athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Height data was generally within the expected range for adult athletes, except for a detected outlier that was significantly below plausible human height. This outlier was identified as a data entry error and has been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The market value data, when log-transformed, displayed a distribution that suggests a wide range but with most values clustering around the lower end, which is typical in professional sports.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Player positions showed expected distributions, with defenders and midfielders being the most common. This aligns with the standard composition of football teams.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Club and country representation provided insight into the dataset's geographical diversity, with a strong European focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations:\n",
    " * The dataset may still contain inaccuracies or incomplete entries that were not identified during the initial analysis. Further data validation against external sources could improve reliability but is beyond the scope of this project in the interest of time.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Some visualizations were limited to the top 20 clubs or countries by representation, which may overlook insights from a broader dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The correlation analysis was constrained to numerical features and did not include potential relationships with categorical data, which could provide additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations:\n",
    " * Future analyses could benefit from integrating more detailed player performance data to enrich market value assessments and provide more nuanced insights into player valuation.\n",
    " * Expanding the club and country analyses to include a larger subset or the entire dataset would offer a more comprehensive view of player distribution.\n",
    " * A deeper statistical analysis, including regression models or predictive analytics, could uncover more intricate relationships and patterns within the data.\n",

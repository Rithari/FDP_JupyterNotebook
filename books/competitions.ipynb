    "The dataset appears to contain information about various sports competitions. Our aim is to explore this dataset to uncover insights into the different types of competitions, their geographic distribution, and other characteristics that might be present. We'll look into aspects such as competition types, countries involved, and any other unique attributes of these competitions.\n",

The decision depends on the significance of these columns for our analysis.\n",

Similarly, the `domestic_league_code` is missing for the `UEFA Champions League` and `UEFA Europa League` competitions, which are not domestic competitions. Therefore, we can group those into a new category called \"International\" for both columns."

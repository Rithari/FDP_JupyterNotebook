    "- Club Positions (`away_club_position` and `home_club_position`): Both of these columns still have a considerable amount of missing data, about 29.83%. Given that these columns could provide valuable insights into the performance and ranking of the clubs at the time of the game, we might consider handling these missing values carefully.

    "- Club Names (`home_club_name` and `away_club_name`): These columns are missing 17.25% and 15.41% of their data, respectively. Given the importance of club names for identification and analysis, we might replace missing values with a placeholder like \"Not Available\" or \"Unknown\". This approach retains the row's other data while acknowledging the absence of specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attendance: About 14.59% of attendance data is missing. If attendance figures are not central to our primary analysis objectives, we might fill these missing values with a placeholder or an average value, depending on the nature of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manager Names and Referee: The `home_club_manager_name`, `away_club_manager_name`, and `referee` columns have relatively low levels of missing data (around 1.14% and 0.91%, respectively). We could consider replacing missing values with \"Unknown\" to maintain data integrity without significantly impacting the overall dataset.\n",

    "Given the significant role of a club's position in analyses and the high level of missing data (29.83%), imputation is not a viable option due to the potential bias it could introduce. The most appropriate approach is to replace missing values with \"Unknown\". This acknowledges the absence of the data while maintaining the integrity of the remaining dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Club Names (`home_club_name` and `away_club_name`):\n",
    "The absence of club names in a dataset about games is problematic, as it directly impacts the ability to link data to specific clubs and their performance. Before deciding to drop these rows, we should check if the club names can be derived from other data within the same row, such as club IDs. If not, dropping these rows might be the most sensible action since the lack of club identification severely limits the analytical value of these records.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attendance:\n",
    "With a relatively small proportion of missing data (14.59%) and considering the secondary importance of attendance figures in our analysis, replacing missing values with a placeholder like \"Data Not Available\" is a practical solution.

    "\n",
    "- Manager Names and Referee (`home_club_manager_name`, `away_club_manager_name`, `referee`):\n",
    "Given the low level of missing data, replacing the missing values with \"Unknown\" seems to be a practical solution. This allows us to keep these rows in the dataset for broader analysis without significantly impacting the overall data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stadium:\n",

    "# Insights and Conclusions\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "1. Goal Distribution: Home teams generally score more goals than away teams, with most teams scoring between 0 to 3 goals per game.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Seasonal Trends: There are noticeable fluctuations in the average number of goals per game across different seasons, indicating varying game dynamics over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Home Advantage: Home teams tend to win more often, as indicated by the higher frequency of home wins in the game outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Referee Influence: While the referees show some variation in the distribution of game outcomes, the home advantage trend persists across different referees.\n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "### Missing Data\n",
    "Despite our best efforts to handle missing data, the initial absence of certain information (e.g., club formations, some club names) could limit the comprehensiveness of our analysis.\n",
    "### Causal Inference\n",
    "The analysis primarily identifies correlations and patterns rather than causation. For example, referee influence on game outcomes needs further investigation to rule out other confounding factors.\n",
    "### Historical Data\n",
    "Our insights are based on historical data, which may not fully predict future trends, especially in a dynamic field like sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recommendations\n",
    "* Conducting deeper statistical tests to understand the factors influencing game outcomes.\n",

    "* Building predictive models for forecasting game results or player performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exploring other aspects of the dataset, like the impact of specific players or team strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "The dataset provides valuable insights into football game dynamics, particularly highlighting the home team advantage.\n",
    "Seasonal variations suggest that external factors (such as team strategies or player transfers) significantly impact game outcomes over time.\n",
    "Further analysis, possibly using advanced statistical methods or predictive modeling, could provide more in-depth insights, especially in understanding the causality behind observed patterns."
